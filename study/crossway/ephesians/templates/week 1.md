# WEEK 1: OVERVIEW: THE CHURCH IN GOD'S PLAN

## Getting Acquainted

The audience of Ephesians was well-known to the apostle Pual `(Acts 19)`. For two years the disciples in Ephesus observed Paul daily reasoning about the kingdom of God and teaching the Scriptures `(Acts 19:8-10)`. This ministry resulted in a gospel witness spreading throughout the Roman province of Asia. The message of Christ reached those practicing dark arts and worshiping Artemis in this great ancient city, where [[week 1#^02b2c8|demoniac]] influence was strong.

Paul explains these believers' formation into a church as the work of Christ alone. The decree of God always included the formation of the beautiful bride of Christ-the body of Christ, of which Christ is the head.

Ephesians concerns the mystery of the church in the plan of God. The letter calls believers to walk in love, holiness, and wisdom within their local church congregation and in the world. Paul reveals that this mystery concerns earthly, present matters, as well as matters in the invisible realm, bot in the present world and in the world to come.

## Definitions
Demon - An evil spirit that can inhabit a human being and influence him or her to carry out its will. Demons are fallen angels, created by God and always limited by him. Jesus and his followers cast out many demons, demonstrating Jesus' superiority over them. All demons will one day be destroyed along with Satan `(Matt. 25:41; Rev. 20:10)`. ^02b2c8
