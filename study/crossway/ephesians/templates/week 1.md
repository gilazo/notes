# WEEK 1: OVERVIEW: THE CHURCH IN GOD'S PLAN

## Getting Acquainted
The audience of Ephesians was well-known to the apostle Pual `(Acts 19)`. For two years the disciples in Ephesus observed Paul daily reasoning about the kingdom of God and teaching the Scriptures `(Acts 19:8-10)`. This ministry resulted in a gospel witness spreading throughout the Roman province of Asia. The message of Christ reached those practicing dark arts and worshiping Artemis in this great ancient city, where [[week 1#^02b2c8|demoniac]] influence was strong.

Paul explains these believers' formation into a church as the work of Christ alone. The decree of God always included the formation of the beautiful bride of Christ-the body of Christ, of which Christ is the head.

Ephesians concerns the mystery of the church in the plan of God. The letter calls believers to walk in love, holiness, and wisdom within their local church congregation and in the world. Paul reveals that this mystery concerns earthly, present matters, as well as matters in the invisible realm, bot in the present world and in the world to come.

## Placing It in the Larger Story
The Lord revealed the inclusion of Gentiles in his plan of salvation when he called Abram and made promises to bless all nations through him `(Gen. 12:1-3)`. From the begginings of the Lord's dealin with Israel, Gentiles came to the God of Israel-as when Rahab and Ruth left their gods to follow him.

Even though Israel as a whole rejected their [[#^068880|Messiah]], Jesus told his initial Jewish followers that he would build the church and that they would havea significant role in its growth `(Matt. 16:18)`. In doing so, he indicated that something new had dawned in the messianic age-an assembly, "my church," distinguished from greater Israel. The book of Acts shows that soon after the church's formation, Gentiles joined the assembly without converting to Judaism or following the Mosaic law. The inclusion of the Gentiles into the largely Jewish church raised strong feelings among both believing and unbelieving Jews `(Acts 11:1-3;21:20-25)`.

Ephesians explains the theology of the inclusion of those formerly outside the covenant with Israel. Believing Jews and Gentiles in Ephesus are part of a larger design. The church will transform the marriages, work, parenting, and morality of her members. She will become the true temple of God.

> "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them" (Eph. 2:10)

## Date and Historical Background
Paul wrote Ephesians during his first imprisonment `(3:1;4:1;6:20)`. He is therefore writing in AD 62, about five years after his final meeting with the elders of this assembly `(Acts 20:17-35)`. Christianity is still in its infancy, being only a thirty-year-old movement. Unlike other New Testament letters, one does not discern any error, conflict, or misunderstanding that prompts the writing of this letter. Paul writes simply to advance Christian insight and maturity.

## Definitions
**Demon** - An evil spirit that can inhabit a human being and influence him or her to carry out its will. Demons are fallen angels, created by God and always limited by him. Jesus and his followers cast out many demons, demonstrating Jesus' superiority over them. All demons will one day be destroyed along with Satan `(Matt. 25:41; Rev. 20:10)`. ^02b2c8

**Messiah** - Transliteration of a Hebrew word meaning "anointed one", the equivalent of the Greek word *Christ*. Originally applied to a person specially designated for a particular serving role, such as king or priest. Jesus himself affirmed that he was the Messiah sent from God `(Matt. 16:16-17)`. ^068880
