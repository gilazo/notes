# WEEK 2: BELIEVERS' SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS

## The Place of the Passage
Paul begins Ephesians by revealing that the church is a spiritual entity initiated and formed by Christ, leading to a social identity of earthly relationships. The blessings of the church's heavenly identity become the basis for the new kind of conduct Paul exhorts the church to practice.

## The Big Picture
`Ephesians 1:1-14` shows that the church is part of the plan of God from all eternity. God forms the church in Christ to bring himself glory. This is a demonstration of God's [[#^174c20|grace]] based on the work of Christ and intended to accomplish God's will both here on earth and in heaven.

## Reflections and Discussion
**Read through  `Ephesians 1:1-14` and make note of significant words and concepts. Then review the questions below concerning this introductory sections to Ephesians' discussion of the church and write your notes on them. (For further background, see the *ESV Study Bible*, pages 2262-2263; available online at [esv.org](https://www.esv.org/))**

1. **Apostolic Greeting and Initiation of Themes (1:1-2)**

Paul writes to this church as an "[[#^aa49cf|apostle]] of Christ Jesus by the will of God." What authority does his designation as "apostle" give to this writing? What might the phrases "of Christ Jesus" and "by the will of God" say about the motive of the writing? Why will the combination of this motive and authority be important to the remainder of this letter?

> [!NOTE]

The believers who compromise this church are identified as "saints" who reside "in Ephesus." How does the first term influence the second? How should a local congregation view itself in light of what "saints" means in relationship to both the Lord and fellow believers?

> [!NOTE]

Pauls calls this church "faithful in Christ Jesus" and communicates grace and peace to them from God. What sort of relationship with God is indicated by a judgement of their faithfulness? Why might such a congregation need grace and peace from the Father and Jesus Christ?

2. **Reverlation of Spiritual Blessings in Christ from the Father (1:3-10)**

"Blessed be" denotes that Paul is offering praise to God for the spiritual blessings listed in the verses follow. The blessings are anchored "in Christ"- in his person and work in salvation-and "in the heavenly places." List the spiritual blessings "in" and "through" Christ mentioned in 1:4-6. What defining boundaries do "in Christ" and "in the heavenly places" place on "chosen in him", [[#^063fa7|"predestined"]], and "adopted"?

> [!NOTE]

Paul includes [[#^4a28c2|"redemption"]] and "forgiveness of our trespasses" among the blessings lavished upon believers by grace. What does this working of grace indicate about the Ephesians' previous and current condition?
