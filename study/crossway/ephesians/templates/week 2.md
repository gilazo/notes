# WEEK 2: BELIEVERS' SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS

## The Place of the Passage
Paul begins Ephesians by revealing that the church is a spiritual entity initiated and formed by Christ, leading to a social identity of earthly relationships. The blessings of the church's heavenly identity become the basis for the new kind of conduct Paul exhorts the church to practice.

## The Big Picture
`Ephesians 1:1-14` shows that the church is part of the plan of God from all eternity. God forms the church in Christ to bring himself glory. This is a demonstration of God's [[#^174c20|grace]] based on the work of Christ and intended to accomplish God's will both here on earth and in heaven.

## Reflections and Discussion
**Read through  `Ephesians 1:1-14` and make note of significant words and concepts. Then review the questions below concerning this introductory sections to Ephesians' discussion of the church and write your notes on them. (For further background, see the *ESV Study Bible*, pages 2262-2263; available online at [esv.org](https://www.esv.org/))**

1. **Apostolic Greeting and Initiation of Themes (1:1-2)**

Paul writes to this church as an "[[#^aa49cf|apostle]] of Christ Jesus by the will of God." What authority does his designation as "apostle" give to this writing? What might the phrases "of Christ Jesus" and "by the will of God" say about the motive of the writing? Why will the combination of this motive and authority be important to the remainder of this letter?

> [!NOTE]

The believers who compromise this church are identified as "saints" who reside "in Ephesus." How does the first term influence the second? How should a local congregation view itself in light of what "saints" means in relationship to both the Lord and fellow believers?

> [!NOTE]

Pauls calls this church "faithful in Christ Jesus" and communicates grace and peace to them from God. What sort of relationship with God is indicated by a judgement of their faithfulness? Why might such a congregation need grace and peace from the Father and Jesus Christ?

> [!NOTE]

2. **Reverlation of Spiritual Blessings in Christ from the Father (1:3-10)**

"Blessed be" denotes that Paul is offering praise to God for the spiritual blessings listed in the verses follow. The blessings are anchored "in Christ"- in his person and work in salvation-and "in the heavenly places." List the spiritual blessings "in" and "through" Christ mentioned in 1:4-6. What defining boundaries do "in Christ" and "in the heavenly places" place on "chosen in him", [[#^063fa7|"predestined"]], and "adopted"?

> [!NOTE]

Paul includes [[#^4a28c2|"redemption"]] and "forgiveness of our trespasses" among the blessings lavished upon believers by grace. What does this working of grace indicate about the Ephesians' previous and current condition?

> [!NOTE]

Several terms indicate the Lord's intentions for spiritual blessings: "that we should be," "in love" `(1:4)`, "to the praise of his glorious grace" `(1:6)`, and "to unite all things in him" `(1:10)`. These intentions align with God's eternal will (or "purpose" or "plan"; 1:1, 5, 9, 10). How would you summarize the earthly and eternal goals of the works of Christ in the church and for every believer?

> [!NOTE]

3. **Revelation of Spiritual Blessings in Christ through the Spirit (1:11-14)

In 1:11, "in him", "predestined", "purpose", and "will" carry over previously mentioned truths related to the believers' spiritual blessings. According to these truths, how do believers gain an inheritance in Christ? What is the goal of this inheritance, and why might it carry special signifigance for those "who were the first to hope in Christ"?

> [!NOTE]

The work of Christ in redemption, which began in eternity past, includes the sealing of the Holy Spirit. Hearing the truth of the gospel actualizes this sealing `(1:13)`. What role, then, does belief play in the entire tapestry of salvation discussed in 1:3-14? What assurance of salvation does the working of the Spirit provide?

**Read through the following three sections on *Gospel Glimpses, Whole-Bible Connections, and Theological Soundings*. Then take time to consider the *Personal Implications* these sections may have for you.**

## Gospel Glimpses
**FORGIVENESS.** As sinners we have offended God, broken his laws, disobeyed his commands, and rebelled against his will. This puts enmity between our Maker and us. If this breach is not repaired, the sinner remains in jeopardy of punishment from God. However, in the death and resurrection of Christ, the Lord himself has provided for our forgiveness. `(Matt. 27:28)`. It is an act of his grace toward us `(Eph. 1:78)`.

**ATONEMENT.** Although mentioned directly only once in 1:3-14, the death of Christ is the the centerpiece of spiritual blessing. As the Levitical code states, "It is the blood that makes atonement by the life" `(Lev. 17:11;see Heb. 9:22)`. Christ's life-giving act provided the blood sacrifice that atones for the sins of believers. The cross of Christ is central to all the spiritual blessings we read about in Ephesians.

## Whole-Bible Connections
