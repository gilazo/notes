### Manoah's Barren Wife
In the story of Monoah and his wife (Judges 13), the `angel of the LORD` appears to Monoah's barren wife to tell her that she will have a son.  The `angel of the LORD` also gives her instructions on how she is to raise this divinely announced son.

Monoah's wife informs Manoah of the exchange. The `angel of the LORD` appears to both Monoah and his wife and repeats the instructions. Monoah offers a burnt offering to the `LORD`. As he is doing so the `angel of the LORD` ascends to heaven through the fire on the alter.

The story informs the reader that Manoah and his wife believe they are interacting with nothing more than a `man`. It's only after the `ange of the LORD` ascends to heaven that they realize who/what this divine messenger was.

It's also intriguing what Manoah says to his wife:

> "We shall surely die, for we have seen God" (NRSV, Judges 13:22)

Manoah doesn't identify the divine being as `the angel of the LORD` but as `God` himself.
