I was able to attend my ward's deacon outing to the Gilbert temple to do baptisms for the dead. It was a special moment for me as I got to be there and witness Jeremy's first time participating. It was emotional. And I had the strongest impression while watching the baptisms that the work that was happening there was in fact the work of the Father.

Afterwards we all met up at McDonald's, where the kid's where rough housing and Jeremy shoved our neighbor's son, Benny. Benny fell down and broke his arm/wrist.
