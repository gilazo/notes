### scripture study insights
In the books of Judges, the [[angel of YHWH (the LORD)]] appears quite a bit.  This character intrigues me as modern scholarship have varying ideas of who are what this angel is.

The story of Samson and Deliliah seems weird. Every time Deliliah askes Samson the secret of his strength and he gives her a reason, she immediately betrays him, and yet he ultimately tells her his secret.
